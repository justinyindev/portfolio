    intro:
      "I'm a music-loving, multi-instrumentalist, die-hard Portland Trailblazers fan with a Witcher 3 addiction. I live for music and basketball, and gaming is my escape from reality. The Witcher 3 is my  all-time favorite game, and I love the way it immerses me in a world of adventure and excitement. I'm passionate about connecting with   others who share my interests and values, and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and grow. Whether we're talking music, sports, gaming, or anything else I'm passionate about. I'm here for it.",
